This repository is part of the Bachelor's thesis "Search for pathways of molecule formation in the interstellar medium" supervised by Emilio Martínez-Núñez

### AutoMeKin
AutoMeKin (formerly tsscds) has been designed to discover reaction mechanisms in an automated fashion. Transition states are located using MD simulations and Graph Theory algorithms. Monte Carlo simulations afford kinetic results. The only input is a starting structure in XYZ format.
