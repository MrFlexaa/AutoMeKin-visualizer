# **amk_tools** repository by Diego Garcia Garay
Almost all the code is taken from **amk_tools** repository
https://github.com/dgarayr/amk_tools.

The amk-tools library provides tools to read, process and visualize the reaction networks generated by AutoMeKin (https://rxnkin.usc.es/index.php/AutoMeKin).

The code presented here is based on the following modules from amk_tools

- RXReader. Take the data from RXNet files and create the corresponding networks
- RXVisualizer. Generate the interactive networkx processed by RXReader

To better understand how these tools work, visit this repository and follow the UserGuide Introduction https://github.com/dgarayr/amk_tools/blob/master/UserGuide.md
