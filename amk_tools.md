# **amk_tools** repository by Diego Garcia Garay
Almost the vast majority of the code is taken from **amk_tools** repository
https://github.com/dgarayr/amk_tools.

The amk-tools library provides tools to read, process and visualize the reaction networks generated by AutoMeKin (https://rxnkin.usc.es/index.php/AutoMeKin).

The code presented in AUTOMEKIN_visualizer is based on the following modules from amk_tools

- **RXReader**. Take the data from RXNet files and create the corresponding networks
- **RXVisualizer**. Generate the interactive networkx processed by RXReader

To better understand how these tools work, visit this repository and follow the UserGuide Introduction https://github.com/dgarayr/amk_tools/blob/master/UserGuide.md

## AUTOMEKIN VISUALIZER by Luis Guerrero MÃ©ndez
Here I present the following updates:

- RXVisualizer (new version): This script is esesentially the same as RXVisualizer from amk_tools https://github.com/dgarayr/amk_tools/blob/master/RXVisualizer.py , but with some improvements which will be explained.

- get_network: This script accesses the functions of the RXVisualizer and RXreader modules to create the networks and their interactive representations.
I would like to mention that in the amk_tools repository, there is a command that serves the same purpose **amk_gen_view** (follow the UserGuide **Workflow** for futher information). However, I have used this one that I created because I find it more convenient to use.

- SVG: New script created with the idea of obtaining the interactive network figure (created with Bokeh) in SVG format. This coulnd't be introduced in RXVisualizer due to certain incompatibilities.
